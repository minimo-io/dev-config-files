It won't show you the actual files that have changed, but it'll tell you if there are any new or modified files.\n\n2. `git diff --quiet; git status` : The first part of this command (`git diff --quiet`) will run a quiet version of the Git Diff Command which does not print anything by default except an exit status and when it returns a zero, indicating that nothing has changed in your local repository compared to the remote. If something has changed then it prints the differences. The `;` separates this from the second part of the command (`git status`). The `status` part of this command will output a high-level overview of your current state.\n\n3.  **More detailed**: Use `git diff --cached --name-only; git diff --quiet; git status`. This approach runs a more detailed Git Diff against the index (the staging area, as opposed to the actual changes you made locally and pushed up) and against the remote before outputting the results, with which it outputs any names of modified files.\n4.   **More advanced**: Use `gitk --all` : Opens the Git GUI viewer with the history visualised if your repository has changes and/or commits.\n\nThese commands are a good starting point for getting an idea of what's going on in your repository without having to dig into each individual file. However, as always, be cautious when working with your codebase â€“ those changes might just have changed your life.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":75,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":1779,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}}],"summary":"**git repository check**","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
