This might not be suitable if you want to restrict user permissions.\n3. **Unlicense**: An \"unlicense\" that effectively removes all copyright and licensing restrictions from your code.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n1. **Rust-specific licenses**: Consider using the Rust License, which is a proprietary license specifically designed for Rust projects.\n2. **Open-source by-need licenses**: If you're creating an open-source project, consider using a license like AGPL (Affero General Public License) or EPL (Eclipse Public License).\n\nWhen choosing a license, ensure it aligns with your goals and the needs of your users.\n\nFor a Rust bot hosted on GitHub:\n\n* If you want to allow others to use, modify, and distribute your code freely, consider the MIT License or Apache-2.0 License.\n* If you need more control over how your project is used, consider the BSD License or GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\nKeep in mind that licenses can be complex, so it's always a good idea to:\n\n1. Review the license text carefully.\n2. Consult with legal experts if needed.\n3. Consider using online tools and resources to help with license selection.\n\nHope this helps! Do you have any specific requirements or concerns about your bot?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":38},"start":84,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":39},"start":2276,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":46}}}],"summary":"Open Source Software License for Rust Bot Hosted on GitHub","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
