Here are the steps:\n\n1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:\n```bash\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n2. Update your shell configuration:\n```bash\nbrew link --force htop  # (if prompted, type 'yes')\n```\n3. Install `htop` using Homebrew:\n```\nbrew install htop\n```\n\n**Method 2: Using a Flatpak Package**\n\nSince M1 Minis are based on ARM architecture, we can't use the traditional package managers like Homebrew or MacPorts. However, you can try installing `htop` using a Flatpak package. Here's how:\n\n1. Install Flatpak if you haven't already:\n```bash\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://flathub.org/deb/fpm-repo/main.x86_64.AppImage)\"\n```\n2. Add the Flatpak repository to your system:\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /etc/flatpak\ncd /etc/flatpak\nln -s /etc/flatpak/repo.conf-flatpak.org\n```\n3. Install `htop` using Flatpak:\n```\nflatpak install io.github.hypervnic.lime --arch arm64\n```\n\n**Verify the installation**\n\nOnce you've installed `htop`, verify that it's working by running the command in your terminal:\n```bash\nhtop\n```\n\nIf you encounter any issues or errors during installation, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":17}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":47,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":18}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":1506,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":19}}}],"summary":"Installing Htop on M1 Mini Mac","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
