Using the `Date` object: The `getFullYear()` method can be used to obtain the current year. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\nconst currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();\nconsole.log(currentYear); // It will print out the current year\n```\n\n2. Using JavaScript `new Date()` returns a date object representing GMT of the time at which it was created. Here's another way to get the year:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date();\nconsole.log(date.getFullYear()); // Print out the current year\n```\n3. Another method is using `Date.now()`. This method returns the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since \"Epoch\", i.e., January 1, 1970 at UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), plus an offset in local time. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(new Date(Date.now()).getFullYear()); // Print out the current year\n```\n\n4. Lastly, you can also get the current year by adding 1970 to the unix epoch time in milliseconds, which is a common way to represent dates and times as numbers on Unix-like systems (like UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS):\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date();\nconsole.log(date.getFullYear() - 1970); // Print out the current year\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":50}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":64,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":51}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":1296,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":52}}}],"summary":"Simplest Way To Get The Year In JavaScript.","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
