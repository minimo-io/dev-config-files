That's the US dollar.\nðŸ¤£\nI can create a response for you, but keep in mind that I'll be playing along with the sarcasm. Here's my attempt:\n\n\"Wow, congratulations to whoever came up with the most creative scam coin 'features'. I'm particularly impressed by the bold 3am tweet from a ShillBot. And who needs supply caps or actual value when you can just pretend? Meanwhile, the US dollar is over here, like 'yeah, no thanks, we've got this whole economic thing down pat'\"\n\nPlease keep in mind that this response is entirely tongue-in-cheek and not meant to be taken seriously. Cryptocurrency scams are serious issues, and it's essential to approach them with caution and respect for the victims.\nAnother more sarcastic and funny one\nI'll try again \n\n\"Oh, great, another 'scam coin' with a supply so large, it makes the entire global economy jealous. I'm pretty sure the minting of 25% of the supply in the last 6 months is just a fancy way of saying 'we made this up as we went along'. And who needs actual ownership distribution when you can just throw some holders under the bus and call them 'insiders'? Meanwhile, the real investors are over here, shaking their heads and wondering where they threw their money. That's right, it's the US dollar all the way, because at least it's not a hot mess of made-up numbers\"\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":105}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":41,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":106}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":249,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":107}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":918,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":108}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":96},"start":955,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":109}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":97},"start":1541,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":110}}}],"summary":"scammer says thats usd","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
