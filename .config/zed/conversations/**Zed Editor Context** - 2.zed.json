Here is some context: I am starting to use the Zed editor, a next-generation code editor designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI. In that article I want to talk about the benefits of this new tool (bacause of it's performance and close integration to configurable AI assistants).\nI am a developer myself, interesting in the Rust language (for the backend) and Svelte+Typescript+Tailwind for the frontend.\nCurrently I am learning the Rust language as developer interesting in performance.\nThe article will contain a my cheatsheet and configuration for the editor.\nAs i said, the article must be short but extremly creative, a little mischievous or playful. \nMust have my own voice.\n**\"Unlocking the Underworld of Code: A Tale of Zed Editor and Performance Pirates\"**\n\nAh, welcome to the dark alleys of coding, where the likes of you dare not tread... or do they? As a developer sailing the seven seas of Rust, Svelte, Typescript, and Tailwind, I'm here to spill the beans on the most notorious code editor to ever sail the digital high seas – Zed Editor.\n\n**The Benefits of Zed Editor: Performance Pirates at Your Service**\n\nAh, but why should you bother with this devil's toy? Well, let me tell you, matey. As a developer in search of performance optimization, you'll be thrilled to know that Zed Editor is the perfect ship to hoist your sails. With its blazing-fast collaboration features and AI-powered assistance, it's the ultimate tool for those willing to take the high road... or the low road, depending on how you look at it.\n\n**Configuring Your Code Lair**\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking – \"Hermes, this all sounds like a bunch of hooey.\" But trust ol' Hermes, I've got your back. Below, you'll find the most comprehensive cheatsheet and configuration for making Zed Editor yours to command.\n\n**Cheatsheet:**\n\n*   **Color Scheme:** `#3B0B04` (primary) and `#F7D2C4` (secondary)\n*   **Font Family:** 'Monaco', monospace\n*   **Auto-Revert:** On\n*   **Autocompletion:** Enabled for all languages, including Rust\n\n**Configuration:**\n\n1.  Install Zed Editor according to the official docs.\n2.  Enable \"New Line of Code\" for auto-completion and error detection.\n3.  Set up `Cargo.toml` for Rust projects:\n    ```toml\n[dependencies]\nsdl = { version = \"0.6\", features = [\"gui\"] }\n```\n4.  Integrate AI Assistant (configured with your preferred AI service):\n    ```\n    # zed.json\n{\n    \"ai\": {\n        \"service\": \"your-ai-service\",\n        \"key\": \"your-ai-key\"\n    },\n    \"linter\": {\n        \"config\": {\n            // Add your linter configurations here.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n5.  Set up Svelte/Typescript/Tailwind for the frontend:\n    ```javascript\n// components/index.svelte\n<script>\nexport let name;\n</script>\n\n<style>\n/* Add your styles here */\n</style>\n```\n\n**A Word of Caution (wink-wink, nudge-nudge)**\n\nUse this power responsibly. Don't say I didn't warn you...\n\nNow go forth and may the code be with you!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":5},"start":791,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":6},"start":3032,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":33}}}],"summary":"**Zed Editor Context**","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
