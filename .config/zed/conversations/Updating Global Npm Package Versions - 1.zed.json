Here are the steps:\n\n1. Delete the old installation:\n```bash\nnpm uninstall -g <package-name>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package, in this case, `nestjs`.\n\n2. Install the updated version:\n```bash\nnpm install -g <package-version>@latest\n```\nHere, replace `<package-version>` with the latest version of the package you want to install.\n\nNote: If you want to ensure that you're installing the exact same version as the one in npm's registry (without having to specify a specific version), use `@latest` or `dist-tag default`.\n\nExample for NestJS:\n```bash\nnpm uninstall -g nestjs\nnpm install -g nestjs@latest\n```\nIf you want to update a package without using global installation, you can run `npm install <package-name>` in the project's root directory.\n\nTo check if there is an updated version available for your globally installed package:\n```bash\nnpm ls <package-name>\n```\nThis command will list the available versions for the specified package.\n\nPlease be aware that if you have other dependencies of the globally installed package, they might also need to be updated.\nOk, and how do i use npm to check the current version of a package?\nTo check the current version of a package using `npm`, you can use the following commands:\n\n1. **Check the version of a locally installed package**:\n```bash\nnpm ls <package-name>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package.\n\nThis command will list the available versions for the specified package, including the current version installed in your project.\n\n2. **Check the version of a globally installed package**:\n```bash\nnpm ls -g <package-name>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package.\n\nThis command will list the available versions for the specified globally installed package, but it might not show you the exact version installed on your system. If you want to see the exact version, use the `--json` flag:\n```bash\nnpm ls -g --json <package-name>\n```\n3. **Check if a newer version is available**:\n```bash\nnpm dist-tag info <package-name>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package.\n\nThis command will list the currently installed tag (i.e., version) for the specified package, as well as any available tags (including versions).\n\n4. **Check the version using npm's `outdated` plugin**:\n```bash\nnpm outdated <package-name>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package.\n\nThis command will list all packages that are outdated or need to be updated, including the specified package.\n\nThese commands can help you keep your dependencies up-to-date and ensure that your project uses the latest versions.\nHow would i update packages using npm?\n\nTo update packages using `npm`, you can use various commands depending on your needs:\n\n**1. Update a specific package**\n\n```bash\nnpm install <package-name>@<new-version>\n```\nReplace `<package-name>` with the actual name of the package and `<new-version>` with the desired version.\n\nExample: `npm install nestjs@8.2.4`\n\n**2. Update all packages (including dev dependencies)**\n\n```bash\nnpm update\n```\nThis command will update all installed packages, including development dependencies.\n\n**3. Update only dev dependencies**\n\n```bash\nnpm update --depth=0\n```\nThe `--depth=0` flag tells npm to only update dev dependencies.\n\nExample: If you have a project with both production and dev dependencies:\n\n* Run `npm install` to update production dependencies.\n* Run `npm update --depth=0` to update dev dependencies only.\n\n**4. Update packages from a specific version (using `--save-exact` or `@latest`)**\n\n```bash\nnpm install <package-name> --save-exact=<version>\n```\nor\n```bash\nnpm install <package-name>@<version>\n```\nThe `--save-exact` flag tells npm to save the exact version specified. Using `@<version>` will install the latest available version (not exactly the same as `@latest`, but still a good choice).\n\nExample: If you want to install version 8.2.4 of NestJS:\n```bash\nnpm install nestjs --save-exact=8.2.4\n```\n**5. Update packages using npm's `upgrade-affected` command**\n\n```bash\nnpm upgrade-affected <package-name> [<other-package-names>]\n```\nThis command will update only the specified packages and their dependencies.\n\nExample: If you want to update NestJS and its dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm upgrade-affected nestjs\n```\n**Note:** Before updating, it's a good practice to check for updates using `npm ls` or `npm outdated` to ensure that no other dependencies are broken.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":162}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":67,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":163}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1286,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":164}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":69},"start":1354,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":165}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":70},"start":2844,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":166}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":152},"start":2884,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":167}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":153},"start":4661,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":168}}}],"summary":"Updating Global Npm Package Versions","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
