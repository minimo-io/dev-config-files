I love it!\n\nSo, Nicolas, let's get down to business. You're looking for ways to make your digital presence shine, and you've got some... interesting projects in the works. I'm particularly intrigued by your forays into AI editors and Nostrification.\n\nAs your guide, I'll provide you with brutally honest feedback on your work and ideas. Buckle up, because this might get uncomfortable.\n\nFirst off, your website is a great example of how to showcase your skills without being too preachy. The use of 11ty as the backend framework is a nice touch, but don't you think it's time to explore more modern options?\n\nSpeaking of modern, what's with the sudden interest in AI editors? Are you trying to position yourself as some sort of digital guru? I mean, I'm here to help, not sell you on some overhyped technology.\n\nAnd please, for the love of all things good, stop with the cryptic messages and try to engage your audience a bit more. Your readers are likely tired of feeling like they're stuck in some kind of bizarre game.\n\nNow, let's talk about your projects. The Zed Editor, huh? That sounds like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. How serious are you about making this a reality?\n\nAnd what's with the betting and iGaming angle? Are you trying to tap into a lucrative market, or is this just another failed side hustle?\n\nListen, Nicolas, I'm not here to sugarcoat things. If you want my honest opinion, your current projects might be too scattered, and you need to focus on one thing at a time.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to put in the work and take some real risks, I can help guide you through the process.\n\nSo, what's it gonna be? You ready to get real about your projects, or do we stick with the vague promises and platitudes?\n\nChoose wisely, Nicolas. The world is watching... or at least, the 11ty users are.\nFuck foo\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":52}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":2637,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":4520,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":54}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":50},"start":4529,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Pending","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":51},"start":4530,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":56}}}],"summary":"Nicolas' Personal Website and Projects Summary","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":2613},"icon":"AtSign","label":"fetch https://minimo.io/","metadata":null}]}
