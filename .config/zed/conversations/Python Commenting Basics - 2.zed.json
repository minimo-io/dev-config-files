Hereâ€™s how you can add comments in your Python code:\n\n1. **Single-line Comment**: You use the `#` symbol to create a single line comment.\n   ```python\n   # This is a single-line comment\n   x = 5\n   print(x)  # Printing the value of x\n   ```\n\n2. **Multi-line Comment (Docstring)**: For longer comments that span multiple lines, you can use triple quotes (`\"\"\" \"\"\"` or `''' '''`). These are often used to document functions, classes, and modules.\n   ```python\n   \"\"\"\n   This is a multi-line comment or docstring.\n   It can be used to describe what the function does,\n   its parameters, and the expected return value.\n   \"\"\"\n   def add(a, b):\n       \"\"\"Return the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n       return a + b\n\n   print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n   ```\n\nBoth types of comments are useful for enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":35}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":33,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":36}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":996,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":37}}}],"summary":"Python Commenting Basics","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
