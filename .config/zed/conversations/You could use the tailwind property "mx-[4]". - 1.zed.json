This will give your element a 2px bottom border. You could adjust the value as needed: `-0` to `-8` (inclusive).\n\nRemember, these classes can also be combined with other border utilities if needed such as `border-l`, `border-t`, etc.\n\nIf you want an actual separation space between the borders and content, you may need to use margin-bottom utility class.\nGive me a full example of a border separated by a margin in Tailwind\nSure thing. Here's an example using `border-b-2` for the bottom border and `mb-4` for the margin below:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"border-b-2 mb-4\">\n    <!-- Your content goes here -->\n</div>\n```\n\nThis will give your element a 2px thick bottom border and a margin of 1.5rem (assuming you're using rem units) from the bottom.\nTHe margin it is not working, we need a different approach\nIf you're still having trouble getting the desired result, here are a few alternative approaches:\n\n1. Using flex: You can use display:flex property with border utilities and margin for separating elements.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex items-center border-b-2\">\n    <div class=\"mr-4\">Content</div>\n    <div>Content</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n2. Using Grid: This approach is more complicated but you can separate a border from other content using grid. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 items-center justify-items-stretch mb-4\">\n    <div class=\"\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":233}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":101,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":234}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":26},"start":604,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":235}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":96},"start":673,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":236}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":97},"start":992,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":237}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":174},"start":1051,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Canceled","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":238}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":175},"start":1623,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":239}}}],"summary":"You could use the tailwind property \"mx-[4]\".
