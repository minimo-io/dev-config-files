Since you're using Svelte and npm, I'll guide you through the process.\n\n**Step 1: Update the `package.json` file**\n\nOpen your `package.json` file and update the desired package's version by modifying the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section accordingly. For example:\n```json\n// Before\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"library-name\": \"^1.2.3\"\n  }\n}\n\n// After\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"library-name\": \"^2.0.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n**Step 2: Run `npm update` or `npm install`**\n\nTo download the new version, you need to run `npm update` or `npm install`. However, if you want to explicitly specify the version, use `npm install library-name@2.0.1`.\n\nRun either of the following commands in your terminal:\n```bash\n// Update and install\nnpm update\n\n// Explicitly install a specific version\nnpm install library-name@2.0.1\n```\n**Step 3: Verify the updated dependencies**\n\nAfter running `npm update` or `npm install`, verify that the new version has been successfully installed by checking the `node_modules` directory or using `npm ls library-name`.\n\nTo check the installed version, run:\n```bash\nnpm ls library-name\n```\nThis command will display information about the installed package, including its version.\n\n**Step 4: Test your application**\n\nThoroughly test your Svelte application to ensure that it functions as expected with the updated library version. This may involve checking for any breaking changes or regression issues.\n\nThat's it! By following these steps, you should be able to update a library version in `packages.json` and refresh your project to download the new version using npm with Svelte.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":34},"start":142,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":56}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":35},"start":1956,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":57}}}],"summary":"Updating Library Versions Directly","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
