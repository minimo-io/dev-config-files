Here is the basic structure:\n\n```\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\n```\n\nReplace `img.jpg` with the name of your image file and `/path/to/img.jpg` with the path to your image.\n\n**Using Markdown Syntax**\nMost Markdown implementations support a syntax that lets you add captions and link an image's alt-text directly to its source. \n\nIf your image is hosted somewhere on the web, such as on Imgur, GitHub, or another hosting platform, here’s how you’d do it:\n\n```\n![Image Description](https://imageurlhere.com)\n```\n\nReplace \"Image Description\" with a description of what's in your image.\n\n**Using Local Images**\nIf you're creating a Markdown document that will be converted to HTML and the images are not being hosted elsewhere, but instead are stored locally on your computer or server:\n\n```markdown\n![Local Image](/path/to/img.jpg)\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/img.jpg` with the path of your local image file.\n\nRemember, always ensure you have permissions to use any images you're inserting into Markdown documents.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":28}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":40,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":29}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":23},"start":1197,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}}}],"summary":"imgmarkdwn","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
