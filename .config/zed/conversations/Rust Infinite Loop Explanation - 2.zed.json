When this expression is true, the loop will exit.\n\nHere's an example:\n```rust\nloop {\n    println!(\"Loop iteration {}\", 0);\n    if 0 == 0 {\n        break; // exit loop on first iteration\n    }\n}\n\n// This code won't be executed after the loop exits\n\nloop {\n    println!(\"Loop iteration {}\", 1);\n    // no break, so the loop will continue indefinitely...\n}\n```\nIn contrast, a `while` loop is used when you need to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition:\n```rust\nlet mut i = 0;\nloop {\n    if i >= 10 {\n        break; // exit loop after 10 iterations\n    }\n    println!(\"Loop iteration {}\", i);\n    i += 1;\n}\n```\nIn summary, `loop { ... }` is used for infinite loops, while `while` loops are used when you need to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.\nw","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":43}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":45,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":44}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":1370,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":45}}}],"summary":"Rust Infinite Loop Explanation","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
