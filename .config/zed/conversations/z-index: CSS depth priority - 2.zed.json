An element with a higher z-index value will be displayed above an element that has a lower z-index value when both elements overlap. It is used for Z-Stacking in CSS. \n\nWhen two elements have the same z-index, the one mentioned later in the HTML code will appear on top. It works similarly to layers in some drawing software. The higher the stack, the closer it appears to the viewer.\n\nA typical example: You want a popup notification overlaying your website. So you set this 'overlay' to be on top of everything else by giving it a higher z-index value than your main web page.\n\nIn the same way, an element with a lower z-index will always display behind elements with a higher z-index, regardless of their position in the source code. This property is mostly used for layered websites and can be useful when overlapping webpage components need to show or hide.\nOk, do elements need to have any specific position property?\nYes, generally, elements that are positioned using `position` CSS property in order to work with the z-index. Without a position, the `z-index` would not affect the element, and the elements would display in source code order (default). The main positions include `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`. These types of positioning are used for different kinds of layering effects on webpages.\n\nThe default `position` is `static`. When an element is not positioned, its position in the page depends on source order and may have a z-index that affects how it's displayed. \n\nIn summary: The `z-index` CSS property controls the stack level of the box generated by an HTML element; the higher the value, the nearer to the topmost position; elements with a lower z-index will be obscured by those having a higher one. Position property determines where the element should be placed and how it would stack with other z-indexed elements on the page. So, if you're not explicitly setting an element's position or z-index, it falls back to the default 'auto', which is based on source order.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":91}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":69,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":92}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":1019,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":93}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":83},"start":1080,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":94}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":84},"start":2169,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":95}}}],"summary":"z-index: CSS depth priority","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
