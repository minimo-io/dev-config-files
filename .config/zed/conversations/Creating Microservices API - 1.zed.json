This is a simplified example, but it should give you a good starting point.\n\n**Step 1: Create a new Actix-web app**\n\nFirstly, let's create a new Actix-web app for our reporting service.\n```rust\n// src/reports.rs\n\nmod reports {\n    use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};\n    use serde_json::json;\n\n    pub async fn index() -> HttpResponse {\n        return HttpResponse::Ok().body(json!({ \"message\": \"Reporting Service Online\" }));\n    }\n\n    #[get(\"/status\")]\n    pub async fn status() -> HttpResponse {\n        let response = HttpResponse::Ok()\n            .insert_header(\"X-Service\", \"Reports\")\n            .finish();\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    HttpServer::new(|| {\n        App::new()\n            .service(web::resource(\"/\").to(reports::index))\n            .service(web::resource(\"/status\").to(reports::status))\n    })\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8083\")?\n    .run()\n    .await\n}\n```\n**Step 2: Connect the `reporting` microservice to your main app**\n\nTo connect this new service to our main Rust project, we need to make sure that our reporting microservice is running and accessible.\n\nFirstly, we'll create a function to start our Actix-web server.\n```rust\n// src/main.rs\n\nmod reports;\n\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    // Start the report microservice\n    let _ = tokio::spawn(async move {\n        HttpServer::new(|| {\n            App::new()\n                .service(web::resource(\"/\").to(reports::index))\n                .service(web::resource(\"/status\").to(reports::status))\n        })\n        .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8083\")?\n        .run();\n    });\n\n    // Your other functions here\n}\n```\nThis is a very basic example and will only work if you are running it from the same process.\n\n**Step 3: Run your main app and check if everything works**\n\nWe need to run our new actix-web server using `cargo run`, then we can send requests to this new microservice. You should be able to see that everything is working as expected.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run --release\n```\nThen, use a tool like `curl` from your terminal or your preferred http client tool.\n```bash\n$ curl 127.0.0.1:8083/\n{\n    \"message\": \"Reporting Service Online\"\n}\n\n$ curl 127.0.0.1:8083/status\nX-Service: Reports\n```\nThis is the basic structure for a new microservice in your existing Rust project.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you have actix-web, serde_json and tokio installed as dependencies.\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nactix-web = \"4.0.0\"\nserde_json = { version = \"1\", features = [\"derive\"] }\ntokio = { version = \"1\", features = [\"full\"] }\n```\nok, let's start over. What i need is an status micro-service, that will be in a separate folder (from my current \"api\" and \"exchange-rates\")\nLet's create a new Rust project for the Status microservice.\n\n**Create a new project**\n\n Run the following command to create a new Rust project:\n```bash\ncargo new status-microservice --bin --template actix-web\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `status-microservice` with an empty `src/main.rs` file and other necessary files for a basic Actix-web application.\n\n**Move the Actix-web code to its own module**\n\n Move the Actix-web related code from your current project's `main.rs` to this new project. Create a new directory called `web` in the `status-microservice` project, and move the relevant code into it:\n```bash\nsrc/\n|- main.rs -> web/main.rs\n|- reports -> status-reports/src/reports.rs\n```\n**Update the `main.rs`**\n\nUpdate the `main.rs` to use the new Actix-web module:\n```rust\n// src/web/main.rs\n\nmod reports;\nmod web;\n\n#[actix_web::main]\nasync fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {\n    HttpServer::new(|| {\n        App::new()\n            .service(web::resource(\"/\").to(reports::index))\n            .service(web::resource(\"/status\").to(web::status))\n    })\n    .bind(\"127.0.0.1:8083\")?\n    .run()\n    .await\n}\n```\n**Update the `src/reports.rs`**\n\nYou can keep your reporting code as is:\n```rust\n// src/web/src/reports.rs\n\nmod reports {\n    use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};\n    use serde_json::json;\n\n    pub async fn index() -> HttpResponse {\n        return HttpResponse::Ok().body(json!({ \"message\": \"Reporting Service Online\" }));\n    }\n\n    #[get(\"/status\")]\n    pub async fn status() -> HttpResponse {\n        let response = HttpResponse::Ok()\n            .insert_header(\"X-Service\", \"Reports\")\n            .finish();\n        return response;\n    }\n}\n```\n**Link the `web` module to the main app**\n\nTo make it work, you'll need to add the `web` module to your current project. Create a new file called `Cargo.toml` in the root of your project:\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nactix-web = \"4.0.0\"\nserde_json = { version = \"1\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n```\nThen, add the `status-microservice` to your `target/deps.rs` file:\n```rust\n// target/deps.rs\n\nuse status_microservice::web;\n\nfn main() {\n    // ... other code ...\n}\n```\nThis way, when you run your main project, it will spawn a new instance of the Actix-web server for the Status microservice.\n\nThat's it! You should now be able to start your Status microservice by running `cargo run --release`. Then, you can access the `/status` endpoint to see its status.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":164}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":38},"start":139,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":165}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":39},"start":2873,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":166}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":156},"start":3014,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":167}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":157},"start":5456,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":168}}}],"summary":"Creating Microservices API","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
