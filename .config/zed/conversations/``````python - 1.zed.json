Here is an example:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nThis will render as follows:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nNote that the language of the code (like 'python' in this case), must be indicated immediately after the opening backtick. This indicates what type of syntax highlighting you'd like to use when displaying your code.\n\nAlso, note that it's important to not include any spaces between the backticks and the language name.\n\nIf you want multiple code blocks, just make sure they're each separated by at least one blank line.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":39}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":43,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":40}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":12},"start":691,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":41}}}],"summary":"``````python","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
