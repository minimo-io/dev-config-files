Be as concise as possible.\nDependency Injection (DI) is a technique used in software design to manage relationships between objects within an application. The main purpose of DI is to separate the code responsible for creating these objects from the code that uses them. This can be done using libraries like NestJS.\n\nNestJS is a framework that leverages TypeScript, JavaScript's superset, to develop Node.js applications in a way inspired by Angular and Express. The reason behind DI here is to have a dynamic way of creating objects at runtime that are used across the application.\n\nIn NestJS, services and modules can be injected into other services with Dependency Injection, which enables an object to get a hold of its dependencies in a clean manner. This makes the code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to test.\n\nTo summarize, DI in software like NestJS:\n1. Decouples services (objects), reducing dependencies between them.\n2. Helps create new objects dynamically, based on runtime conditions or user requests.\n3. Automatically manages the life cycle of these services.\n4. Increases code reusability and modularity.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":128}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":59},"start":138,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":129}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":60},"start":1240,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":130}}}],"summary":"Dependency Injection in NestJSThis title is concise yet still provides the context about dependency injection within the framework of NestJS.","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
