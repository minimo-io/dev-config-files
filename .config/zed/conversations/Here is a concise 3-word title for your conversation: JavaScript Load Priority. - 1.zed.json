The load priority is determined by the order in which the scripts are listed in the head section of the HTML document.\n\nTo change the load priority, you can simply rearrange the order of the script tags in the head section of your HTML file. For example, if you want to prioritize a specific script over others, you can place it at the top of the list, while scripts that should be loaded last can be placed at the bottom.\n\nIt's important to note that changing the load priority may have an impact on the performance and functionality of your web application. It's recommended to test the changes in a controlled environment before deploying them to production.\n\nHow to configure a script load priority?\nTo configure a script load priority, you can use the `defer` and `async` attributes in your script tags. The `defer` attribute tells the browser to defer loading the script until after the page has loaded, while the `async` attribute tells the browser to load the script asynchronously without blocking rendering of the page.\n\nBy using the `defer` attribute, you can ensure that the script is loaded later in the page load process, giving other elements on the page a chance to render first. This can be useful for scripts that have side effects or perform long-running tasks, such as data processing or third-party API calls.\n\nBy using the `async` attribute, you can allow other elements on the page to render while the script is being loaded. This can improve the overall performance of your web application, especially if you have many scripts that need to be loaded quickly.\n\nIt's important to use these attributes carefully and test the changes in a controlled environment before deploying them to production. Additionally, you should consider other factors such as the size of the script, the complexity of its functionality, and the impact on rendering performance when making load priority decisions.\n\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":82}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":13},"start":46,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":83}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":818,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":84}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":74},"start":859,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":85}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":75},"start":2069,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":86}}}],"summary":"Here is a concise 3-word title for your conversation: JavaScript Load Priority.","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
