Here are the steps:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Navigate to the directory where your local repository is located using `cd /path/to/your/repo`.\n3. Run the command `git remote -v`.\n\nThis will display information about all remotes that have been configured in your Git configuration file.\n\nIf you want to check the status of a specific remote, use:\n```\ngit remote <remote-name> -v\n```\nReplace `<remote-name>` with the actual name of the remote repository.\n\nFor example, if your repository has a remote named `origin`, you would run:\n```bash\ngit remote origin -v\n```\nThis will show you information about the `origin` remote, such as its URL and whether it's valid.\n\n...and that's it. Quite straightforward, isn't it?\n\n(P.S. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, I can also provide more advanced Git-related instructions. Just let me know.)\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":19}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":13},"start":42,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":20}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":1034,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":21}}}],"summary":"**Git Repository Status Inquiry**","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
