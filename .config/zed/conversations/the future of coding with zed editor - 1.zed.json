Well, actually... it's Zed.  I've been seeing this new editor, and things are getting pretty serious.\n\nAfter years of watching the CPU fan of my old Macbook Air (13-inch, early 2015) go crazy just to open a Typescript file, I stumbled upon Zed  - a next-gen code editor written in Rust, designed for high-performance collaboration with humans and AI. \n\nYep, Zed is another AI editor on the rising. There is also some [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) out there, for which I could not care less at the moment. But an open-source editor that [rises $10M](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/zed-code-editor-raises-10m/), well, it just happens that I am.\n\nBut the real game-changer? I've hooked it up with [llama3.2-3b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) through Ollama as my AI coding buddy (yep, i do like tiny open-source models, and nop, they are not as good as Claude or ChatGPT),\nand things are rolling just fine.\n\nOf course you can configure Zed to work with Anthropic, GIthub Copilot or OpenAi. For this you will just need to upload your API keys in the corresponding Assistant config.\n\nThe editor is in v0.158.2 as the time of writting, has few useful extensions and basic snippets, but boy it's fast.\n\nI've been switching my stack since 2023, focusing more and more on performance. \nI still have have a long way to go, but as was my interest in Eleventy and Static-Site-Generators, it's now time for editors like Zed and the Rust Language for my backend and AI related adventures.\n\n(Stay tuned for my upcoming article about Ollama - it's a whole other rabbit hole of local AI goodness.)\n\nSpeaking of Rust - as someone diving into the world of zero-cost abstractions and fighting the borrow checker, Zed feels like the best choice.\nWeekly updates tell me that the development is undergoing in a good rythm.\n\nSo I am hopeful to fully substitute Visual Studio Code soon.\n\n## My Setup: Zed's Configuration\n\nI'll be sharing my actual Zed config here that you can shamelessly copy. \nExpect some carefully crafted settings for both Rust and (Svelte + TypeScript + Tailwind) development, plus my Ollama integration setup.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nIf you're tired of your editor using more RAM than Chrome, or if you're curious about integrating AI into your workflow without paying for tokens to get paid or selling your soul, give Zed a shot. See if it fits your needs. Check it's performance, it AI integration and Collaboration capabilities and decide.\n\nBTW: You can configure Zed to have the same base keymap as VSCode and also includes \"Vim Mode\", check it out [here](https://zed.dev/docs/vim).\n\nIn any case, use its powers responsibly. Don't say I didn't warn you...\nNow go forth and may the code be with you!\n\nFarewell!\n```\nSpell check this\n\nThe text appears to be a blog post about an experience with the new editor Zed, a Rust-based code editor that integrates with AI. The author shares their initial impression of the editor's performance and configuration options.\n\nTo help improve the readability and accuracy of the text, I'd like to point out some minor errors and suggestions:\n\n*   There are a few instances of misspelled words or phrases, such as \"tiny open-source models\" instead of \"tiny open source models\".
