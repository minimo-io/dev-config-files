{"id":"99c6fb12-f585-438b-a0b3-c7cbdb956388","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"\n\n\n\n> ### Intro.\n> \n> This 2025 I'm launching a couple of new experiments (plus a payments project) ðŸ¤– â‚¿ ðŸš€! **Let this be the pledge that holds me accountable.**\n> \n> ---\n> \n> The first experiment it's called _[Futurewise](http://futurewise.lat)_.\n> An automated AI training platform, with curated AI tools, news & courses for the LATAM market. Minimal, simple, to the point. A sort of BensBites for low GDP countries.\n> \n> Of course that could be fairly described as just another shitty newsletter, but in this case, the experiment, (as all experiments should) has a goal.\n> \n> The goal is to determine whether it is possible for me to automate the whole process of creating & maintaining such a project.\n> <br>\n> From content, to images, to code, to operations, using AI & [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).\n> \n> The idea is to see the extent in which I can handle this challenge, and to learn more about artificial intelligence (mostly) open-source models in the way.\n> \n> Also, trying to automate this process will lead me to understanding, using and maybe creating **AI agents** in 2025. Apart from skill-up my Machine learning, [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) & Python skills.\n> \n> On the other hand, as CTO of [Braaay.com](https://braaay.com) I am learning about wine, driking wine (and craft-beers), a quite lot of them.\n> By result of embracing this commitment to the project, I became acquainted with the subject and the challenges of running a wine e-Commerce & Showroom in SÃ£o Paulo & Uruguay.\n> \n> So in 2025 I will be moving the site, from Woocommerce to a lean and clean Svelte + Tailwind front-end (with a headless Woocommerce in the back, to avoid scaring the crap of the now familiarized editors with the admin interface). Additionally I will use that [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) project to lever a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) mobile app, for the store's Fidelity & Cashback Club.\n> \n> I would prefer [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) as a CMS, but life's, unfair as it is sometimes, it's about tradeoffs. So there is mine. I will have to learn to live with that!\n> \n> And... what does all that have to do with LLM's fine-tunning?\n> \n> Well, at Braaay, we need to elevante the game. The wine market is crowded but growing.\n> \n> My way to elevante the game is to contribute with technology, plus a lot of deep transcendental breathing, with sparse [bike rides](/biking/).\n> \n> So in 2025 I will have to learn how to fine-tune an agent (probably a version of Llama, via [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/)), train it with wine data (already collected from the site), create an [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) version of it and locally host it, using [Cloudflare tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and a Dockerized reverse proxy server.\n> \n> The result will be our own in-house AI wine _sommelier_. Like buscawine.com on steroids.\n> \n> I will use that agent to create several things:\n> \n> - A Wordpress admin plugin for writting AI enhanced content for the site, with internal links.\n> - Another (useless) AI chatbot for the site, just to join the hype.\n> - A wine recommendation system for our app.\n> - An internal training agent.\n> \n> I will be posting all stages of both challenges from [Futurewise](/work/futurewise/) & [Braaay](/work/braaay-store/) below at the experiment changelog.\n> Please (don't) stay tunned, I might just forget to update.\n> \n> Code for the experiments is already open-sourced at Github [here](https://github.com/minimo-io), so feel free to say hi.\n> <br>As for payments project I will post an update (and maybe the project itself) sometime Q2 of 2025, it's called [ViiVPay](/work/viivpay/).\n> \n> Bike around and be safe!\nI want to re-do the whole article, since I have changed my goals.\nI want the new text reflect the tone and ambitions of this manifest:\nMy life business goal is to become an open-source AI expert & Developer, to build ViiVPay (v1  & become a payments expert along the way w/focus on Bitcoin/lightning) & Braaay (new site + app) + Share my experiments at Primal (Nostr) & Minimo.io\nIn terms of AI i want to build: A \"Wine AI Assistant\" for Braaay: Fine-tune an open-source base model from scratch, training it with our brand voice, and the add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities to it. Creating an Ollama version of it and upload it to the cloud, via local Ollama using Cloudflare tunnels and an Nginx server.  Maybe use a Hermes3â€”3B model, or 8B as a startup.\nThis could also be done via MistralAI Le Plataforme.\nâ€”\nI am a techno-optimist, a rugged individualist who believes humans thrive through cooperation.\nIâ€™m an explorer with a laptop and a bag, carrying some food, a handful of tools, some simple clothes; an Infinite card, a Lightning Wallet and my cold storage. A simple guy, that creates and experiments with tech & businesses & self-sufficiency. I love building solutions to my problems in my lab. Dream of switching to Linux and then having a miserable dev life.\nAnd when I fail I smile to this little big thing called life, just try it again, without letting myself be a whiney. Failures feel bad, but I welcome adversity as it's a teacher in disguise.\nI like things that last, a stone, a good tool, a long-term (contrarian) investment, a lifetime relationship. I like to watch life as it is and not as my emotions demand just like my John Mearsheimer.\nI am on command!: \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul\".\nNOW it's time to be, accept the best of the day, to be imperfectly happy. \nThat's true, simple, awesome, raw life, improved by humans and their ingenuity.\nIf others think otherwise, I don't say \"no! you are wrong\", just offer my perspective and a mischievous smile. \nSkeptic of collectivisms, I live life in favor of what is right, instead of against of what's wrong.\nEverybody thinks, and will have an opinion about me: I respect & disagreeâ€¦ knowing that good an evil rest in the heart of every man. So be good. It is not that hard.\nBut I am irreverent, a free cowboy. I am an anti-snobist, anti-authoritarian, protector of my loved ones. Liberal democrat in the style of Paulo Guedes & Hayek. I look people and life through my tough but sensitive open heart like Mike. I smile to censors for they are sad. Inspire them to be less snob & more free like CJC. A free cowboy that returns bad energies with love, including clear limits, looking in the eye,, talking slowly like CharlÃ£o.\nI am Frugal & Efficient. My worn out stuff are the fingerprints of my life, I buy less, love my stuff. I repair! Like the Spirited Man.\nLong-term thinker, aware of 2nd order consequences. Avoider of instant gratifications, with long-term time preference.\nWho thinks that \"Nothing well done is done in a hurry.\" So I do less, I do better.\nPropose curiosity, over fear. \n\nI belong to the global bunch, was born in Uruguay but am deeply connected through the English language to the world (I also think in Spanish, and talk shit in Portuguese), own very liquid assets and a tiny house where I experiment with self-sufficiency, woodworking and tech.\nI move around through the network of roads and lines of mankind. I am a lightweight wandering man in search for wisdom, fun, and good beers & wines; somewhat creative bud, that makes people laugh and money by helping them out when I can, creating extra-ordinaire stuff.\nI wander around like Camilo & Gil Blas.\nI get rejected many times since I like the mischievous life; learned to look forward for it, because there is where things happen. Like a gaucho I am at peace with the thick of the skin Iâ€™ve earned & got. I experiment with my fears so I become fearless. Think that love is art. Money is energy.\nAnd energy is freedom to move around,this little dot hanging from a star.\nEntÃ£o como podemos fazer algo extraordinario hoje?\nI believe in decentralize permission-less protocols:\n- Bitcoin and Lightning for money & wealth.\n- Nostr for speech, communications & online identity.\n- eCash for decentralize banking.\n- Open-source LLMs and AI Agents for intelligence.\n- Internet as a base layer for all digital.\nBe brave you asshole.\nWow, that's quite an introduction!
